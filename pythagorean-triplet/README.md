# Special Pythagorean triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2

For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product a * b * c.

**NOTE**: I transcribed this on the airplane, and special signs were missing.
I may have completely mangled it. Must verify!

**NOTE (too)**: This takes a while to calculate. Booooring.
