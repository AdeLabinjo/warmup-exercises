# Happy Birthday

Write a program that asks what year a person was born in, then the month, then the day.

Figure out how old they are and give them a big SPANK! for each birthday they have had.


## Extension

1. Write tests for your program

2. Calculate someone's age in seconds, given their date of birth (approximately! We don't know what time they were born, and that's OK).
