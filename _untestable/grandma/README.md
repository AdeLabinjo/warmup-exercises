# Grandma

Write a Deaf Grandma program.

Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with

> HUH?!  SPEAK UP, KIDDO!

unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back

> NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.

You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.

## Extensions

1. Let grandma call you random names instead of KIDDO, for example: SWEET PEA, PUMPKIN, CUPCAKE, BAIRN, BAMBINO, MOPPET, SPRAT, SPROUT, SQUIRT, WHELP, RASCAL, etc...

2. You can also stop talking to grandma if you shout other appropriate things, like GOODBYE, SEEYA, CIAO, FAREWELL, etc.

3. What if grandma doesn't want you to leave? When you shout your farewell, she could pretend not to hear you. Change your previous program so that you have to shout farewell three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout farewell three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to grandma.

4. Have grandma tell you a story. Load the story from a .yml file. Grandma will only tell you one line of the story at a time, and to hear the next story you have to tell her "AND THEN".
