# Simple ciphers

"If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."
â€”Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar

Ciphers are very straight-forward algorithms that allow us to render text less readable while still allowing easy deciphering. They are vulnerable to many forms of cryptoanalysis, but we are lucky that generally our little sisters are not cryptoanalysts.

The Caeser Cipher was used for some messages from Julius Caesar that were sent afield. Now Caeser knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but he had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well. So even being a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't recognize the few words that they did know.

Your task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher. This image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher: ![Caesar Cipher](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg/320px-Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg.png)

Here are some examples:

    @cipher = Cipher.new
    @cipher.encode("iamapandabear") #=> "ldpdsdqgdehdu"
    @cipher.decode("ldpdsdqgdehdu") #=> "iamapandabear"
