# Simple ciphers

The weakest link in any cipher is the human being. Let's make your substitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source of randomness and ensuring that they key is not composed of numbers or capital letters.

If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of at least 100 characters in length, accessible via Cipher#key (the # syntax means instance variable)

If the key submitted has capital letters or numbers, throw an ArgumentError with a message to that effect.

Some examples:
    @cipher = Cipher.new
    @cipher.key #=> "duxrceqyaimciuucnelkeoxjhdyduucpmrxmaivacmybmsdrzwqxvbxsygzsabdjmdjabeorttiwinfrpmpogvabiofqexnohrqu"
